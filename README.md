# CPSC222FinalProject
### Personal Flying and Work Correlations

## Topic
This project topic is on aviation, more specifically my flying hours and my work hours from this 
past summer. I am interested in finding correlations and trends between my work and flying time 
to see if there is a significant relationship between them. Since I worked at the flight school 
I learned at, I often planned my schedule by whichever way would optimize the most total flying + 
work time. 

## Organization
The project is organized by an introduction, data analysis, classification, and conclusion
with interleaved markdowns and code. I delve into different types of aggregating, visualizing,
hypothesis, and classifications that extract different kinda of information from my two
csv files.

## Data
The data sets I am using are flying_logbook.csv which contains data on my flying hours, types of flying, etc., 
and work_hours.csv which contain my work hours. These tables are merged together on "Date" and cleaned in 
order to remove unwanted columns and rows that will not be useful for analyzing. In order to learn what each 
attribute in my datasets represent, refer to the technical report introduction. There is a description of 
each attribute that explains its relationship to the data.

## How to Run
In order to run this project, simply "Run All" on the technical_report.ipynb where all the analyzing
occurs. This will also call the csv and utils files which contain useful data and code that will
be implented in the .ipynb. 

## Understand Content
Throughout the techincal report, there will be many sectioons of code that print out results such 
as charts, etc. In order to understand what this means, refer to the markdown associated with the
code.

## Conclusion
To learn more about the implications of these reults, read the conclusion. This summarizes the classification 
and addresses possible impacts, improvements, and other factors that are influenced by this code. Lastly, in my 
conclusion, it says that my sources are notes from class. In order to complete this project, I referenced the 
class notes throughout the semester and a variety of links from the notes such as the sklearn website etc.
